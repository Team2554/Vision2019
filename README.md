# Vision2019

All the python vision code to run on the Raspberry Pi coprocessor for all the vision needs in First Robotics Competition 2019.

## Dependencies

### Deploy

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Actually don't do this. Just upload the file.

### Developing

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Updating Dependencies

Change appropriate version in `requirements-to-freeze.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt`.

### Understanding the code
If anyone can understand this, they are a god.

I am not going to write documentation

My future self will suffer

### Some other info
Don't ask why I used Python

Python is the best programming language when it comes to Computer Vision

Also I don't need to go through the pain of compiling the code into binaries


### VERY IMPORTANT: TODO
IMPLEMENT STUFF FROM CHICKENVISION

https://github.com/team3997/ChickenVision/blob/master/ChickenVision.py

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier. I shouldn't have ignored Neeraj
